| Demo scene inclusion                    | If your product has content to show off, it should be displayed in a demo scene. Please provide a practical demo with all of your assets set up. If your asset is based on scripting or Editor extensions, please consider adding a demo scene showcasing the asset or showing setup steps in the scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Prefabs for meshes                      | Each mesh should have a corresponding prefab set up with all variations of the texture/mesh/material that you are providing. Please create prefabs for all of your imported objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Reset Prefabs                           | Prefabs must have their position/rotation set to 0, and their scale set to 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Colliders for Prefabs with meshes       | Prefabs with meshes inside them have to have colliders applied to them, if the Prefabs are marked as Static. Please make sure you have appropriately sized colliders applied to your prefabs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Empty Prefabs                           | Prefabs cannot be empty, please make sure that you set up your prefabs correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Documentation inclusion                 | If your asset contains any code (scripts, shaders) - we ask that you include offline documentation in the format of pdf or rtf with your submission, as it is mandatory for all packages that include scripts or other components that require set up. Your documentation must be organized with a table of contents and numbered, written in English and have no grammar mistakes. Create a setup guide with a step-by-step tutorial (pdf or video), as well as a script reference if users will need to do any coding. If your asset contains art (3D models, sprites) and you used code to set up a demo scene, you may skip this step. |
| Mesh orientation                        | Meshes should be facing the correct way.

Please remove all SpeedTree files that are in this package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Duplicate animation names               | Your animations cannot contain duplicate names. The user can either use one animation per prefab or have to rename all animation files in the .fbx objects themselves. Make sure that your animations have a naming convention which is easy to understand. Please use underscores or numbers if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| LOD setup                               | We do not allow prefabs that contain a mesh with LOD written in  its name, but without an LOD element or more than 1 mesh attached. Please  make sure that LODs are correctly set up in the prefab. Refer to the LODGroup  Manual to set up your LODs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Shader compilation errors               | An error was found within one or more of your shaders. Please make sure the shaders inside your package do not have errors and compile successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
