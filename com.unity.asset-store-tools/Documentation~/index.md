# About Asset Store Publishing Tools

The Asset Store Publishing Tools allow content creators to submit their content to the [Unity Asset Store](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetStore.html).

This is done by:

1. Creating a new package draft in the [Unity Publisher Portal](https://publisher.unity.com/)
2. Validating the contents of your package using the [Validator Tool](validator-overview)
3. Uploading the contents of your package using the [Uploader Tool](uploader-overview)
4. Submitting the package draft for approval in the [Unity Publisher Portal](https://publisher.unity.com/)

>[!NOTE]
>Validating the package contents is optional, but highly recommended to speed up the process of content approval for the Asset Store.
